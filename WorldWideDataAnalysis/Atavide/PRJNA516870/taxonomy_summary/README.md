# Taxonomy for Bioproject PRJNA516870

This sample comes from the [NCBI BioProject PRJNA516870](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA516870).

Taxonomy was created using [atavide_lite](https://github.com/linsalrob/atavide_lite).



# NORMALIZATIONS

Currently we perform two taxonomy normalizations:

1. *_raw.tsv

This is the non-normalised data, so just the raw counts. 

2. *_norm.tsv

This data is normalised for all reads that have been assigned a taxonomy.
